### Hi there, I'm Jayvee

Currently based in Sweden, I work as a software development consultant helping build complex and efficient applications and websites for client from various industries. I am always eager to join new challenging projects that will take me up to speed with the newest and coolest frameworks and tools.

I shifted to web development early in my career and have loved it ever since: starting with a .Net bootcamp and later becoming a full-stack developer that loves every layer of software development process.
